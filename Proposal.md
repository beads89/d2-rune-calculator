Project's Purpose or Goal: (What will it do for users?)
 
The purpose of this project is to have an application a user can input the quantity of “runes” they have, along with a piece of gear with x amount of sockets and see what “runewords” are possible to create. It is being developed for use with the game “Diablo II” and “Diablo II: Resurrected”. Runes are materials you can collect in the game and “runewords” are formed by inserting runes into gear in a specific order. For example, using the solfa scale syllables as “runes”, the runes “Do”, “Re”, “Mi”, and “Fa” can be inserted in a piece of armor with exactly 4 sockets to create a special piece of gear. In order to do so, they must be inserted in the order of “Re”, “Fa”, “Mi”, “Do” to create the runeword “ReFaMiDo” or else it won’t work, and the player will need to obtain another piece of armor with 4 sockets, along with finding the four runes again, and ensuring they insert the runes in the correct order. 
 
List the absolute minimum features the project requires to meet this purpose or goal:
 
• Show a list of all runes with the ability to select how many of a particular one a player has.
• Select the gear type and number of sockets that piece of gear has (ie, chest piece with 6 sockets, weapon with 2 sockets, etc., etc.).
                • The filter can be specific to only show runewords that require, using the example above, a chest piece with exactly 6 sockets, or anywhere from 2-6 sockets.
• Show what runewords are possible to create, what order to place the runes in, and the stats that runeword will have. 
 
What tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, modules and/or other resources (whatever is specific to your track, and your language) will you use to create this MVP? List them all here. Be specific.
 
• HTML
• CSS
• JavaScript
• Reactjs
• C#
• MySQL
• Possibly create my own API to host all the runes and runewords
 
If you finish developing the minimum viable product (MVP) with time to spare, what will you work on next? Describe these features here: Be specific.
 
• Authentication to login and save a player’s set of runes
• Select a specific type of armor or weapon to create your runeword(Ghost Shroud which has low armor value and a low strength requirement to equip, or Ancient Armor which has high armor value but a high strength requirement to equip, etc., etc.) 
• Hosting on AWS or Azure
• Pages that show every runeword available in the game and all armor base types to plan for current/future characters
• Side column filters to only show certain types of runewords(kind of like a side filter on a shopping website)
 
What additional tools, frameworks, libraries, APIs, or other resources will these additional features require?
 
• AWS or Azure 
• Possibly others? Won’t know until I get into the thick of things!
 
Is there anything else you'd like your instructor to know?
 
This is something that has a very niche use, but I think it’d be a good tool to share with friends and others who play this game!
